# dotfiles
This is the dotfiles branch for the docker host 'Odyssee'. My main PC can be found in the master branch.

## What's in there
This branch contains configs for these tools:
- ZSH
- Vim
- Neovim
- lf
- vifm
- ranger

### ZSH


### Vim
Vim is configured by vim-plug, after Vundle decided to vanish :(
Plugins used are:
- This
- that


### Neovim
My Neovim config is powered by lazy.nvim, based on LazyVim.org and adapted to my needs.


### lf
This filemanager is like ranger, but different :)


### vifm
Configured as a dualpane filemanager, it is a nice alternative to midnightcommander.


### ranger
yet another filemanager, I used to use more often, before I started using lf.


### more configs
Some other things configured with these dotfiles are the output of docker commands
